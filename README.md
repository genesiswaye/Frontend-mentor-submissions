## 🚀 Overview

### 🎯 The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on screen size (responsive)
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### ✅ Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Google Fonts (Karla)
- Mobile-first workflow

## 🛠️ My Process

### 1. HTML Structure
I structured the layout using semantic containers like `div`, `section`, and appropriate heading tags (`h3`, `h4`, etc.).

### 2. CSS Layout
Used a combination of Grid for the top section and Flexbox for the two-column pricing/details layout. Background colors were taken from the HSL values specified in the challenge, with adjustments made for better contrast.

### 3. Responsiveness
The page was styled using a mobile-first approach with relative units and a combination of Flexbox and Grid layouts to ensure it looks good on all screen sizes. Media queries were used to adapt the layout — particularly by stacking columns on smaller screens (like 375px wide devices) to maintain readability and usability.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to blend Grid and Flexbox layouts in a component-style design
- Customizing color overlays and shades using HSL adjustments
- Managing typographic hierarchy with font weight and spacing
- Structuring CSS for maintainability and clarity
- Writing media queries to make components responsive on different screen sizes

## 🔄 Continued Development

- Add hover state to the "Sign Up" button
- Implement mobile responsiveness using media queries
